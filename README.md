# azure_bus_issue

This repository is created to demonstrate the issue [#23875](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/23875)  of azure service bus when testing with angular, karma, jasmine. 

The test suite is in the file [azure-bus.service.spec.ts](https://github.com/jeme95/azure_bus_issue/blob/master/src/app/services/azure-bus.service.spec.ts)

To run that, run the command ``` ng test```

A screenshot of the run is below

A sender is created, and then it hangs where the message is supposed to be sent
